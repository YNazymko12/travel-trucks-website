# Travel Trucks

The **Travel Trucks Website** is a single-page application built to showcase a
unique collection of travel trucks available for viewing. The website provides a
clean, user-friendly interface to explore and learn about each truck. Designed
with React and Redux, the project uses efficient state management to handle data
and interactions within the app. Although currently optimized for desktop users,
future improvements may include responsive design.
